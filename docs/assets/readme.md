# How to embed an image
> Now insert Markdown text to specify an image. It’s the same as for a link, but preceded by a ! character. For example, if you want to show a file named logo.png in the assets directory (really /docs/assets in this example), you’d employ this Markdown. Note that the text in between the [ and ] should be a clear description of the image. It’s used by screen readers for visually impaired users.
